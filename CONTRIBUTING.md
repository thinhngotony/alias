- PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows)
- [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) for linting

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Linux/macOS - Test install
bash install.sh

# Verify aliases loaded
source ~/.alias/load.sh
type gs  # Should show alias

# Test uninstall
bash uninstall.sh
```

```powershell
# Windows - Test install
.\install.ps1

# Verify aliases loaded
. ~\.alias\load.ps1
Get-Command gs  # Should show function

# Test uninstall
.\uninstall.ps1
```

### Linting

sudo apt install shellcheck  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install shellcheck      # macOS

# Run linter
shellcheck install.sh uninstall.sh load.sh aliases/*.sh
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Shell Scripts (Bash)

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Quote all variables: `"$var"` not `$var`
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditionals
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

### PowerShell Scripts

- Use approved verbs for function names
- Add `[CmdletBinding()]` for advanced functions
- Use `$PSScriptRoot` for relative paths
- Follow [PowerShell Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-development-guidelines)

### Alias Naming

- Keep aliases short (2-4 characters)
- Use lowercase
- Avoid conflicts with common commands
- Be consistent with existing patterns
